line,

00:34.520 --> 00:34.780
let's

00:34.780 --> 00:34.900
see

00:34.900 --> 00:35.020

00:48.700 --> 00:48.900
This

00:48.900 --> 00:49.200
isn't

00:49.200 --> 00:49.400
saying.

00:50.280 --> 00:50.500
I'm

00:50.500 --> 00:50.680
good.

00:50.940 --> 00:51.200
I'm

00:51.200 --> 00:51.320

00:54.460 --> 00:54.780
twins

00:54.780 --> 00:55.080
