00:00.080 --> 00:01.560
Guess which twin has the key?

00:01.820 --> 00:02.660
Wind 10 Grand.

00:02.860 --> 00:04.940
Take your blindfold off and look for the differences.

00:05.240 --> 00:06.840
The one on the right has the key.

00:07.260 --> 00:08.360
All right, go behind the curtain.

00:09.020 --> 00:09.860
They look identical.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.460
10 Grand, which one has the key?

00:12.620 --> 00:14.440
Oh, I'm gonna go with all the right.

00:16.000 --> 00:16.740
You guys correctly!

00:17.380 --> 00:17.800
No!

00:18.080 --> 00:18.960
Bring out the triplet.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.800
Do you want to risk it all in double it for 20k?

00:24.720 --> 00:25.460
Yeah, let's do it.

00:25.580 --> 00:25.960
Really?

00:26.300 --> 00:27.380
She will now have the key?

00:27.540 --> 00:29.100
Look for the differences between them.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.320
All three look the same.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.180
They have now mixed up randomly.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.300
With 20k dollars on the line,

00:34.520 --> 00:35.860
let's see if you can guess correctly.

00:36.680 --> 00:37.740
The far left.

00:38.100 --> 00:38.760
The one on the left.

00:40.160 --> 00:40.680
She does!

00:42.220 --> 00:43.780
I lied about them being triplets.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.260
You know where this is going.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.480
Do you want to risk it all again for 40k dollars?

00:48.700 --> 00:49.400
This isn't saying.

00:50.280 --> 00:50.680
I'm good.

00:50.940 --> 00:51.320
I'm good.

00:51.320 --> 00:51.740
You're good.

00:51.960 --> 00:52.860
Good, congrats, man!

00:53.020 --> 00:56.340
Now go watch 100 identical twins battle for 250 grand.
