00:00.140 --> 00:00.440
So

00:00.440 --> 00:00.720
in

00:00.720 --> 00:00.980
school,

00:01.140 --> 00:01.200
I

00:01.200 --> 00:01.560
studied

00:01.560 --> 00:02.040
electrical

00:02.040 --> 00:02.520
engineering

00:02.520 --> 00:02.760
and

00:02.760 --> 00:03.000
physics

00:03.000 --> 00:03.260
because

00:03.260 --> 00:03.480
I

00:03.480 --> 00:03.720
absolutely

00:03.720 --> 00:04.120
love

00:04.140 --> 00:04.440
both

00:04.440 --> 00:04.580
getting

00:04.580 --> 00:04.780
my

00:04.780 --> 00:05.020
hands

00:05.020 --> 00:05.280
dirty,

00:05.320 --> 00:05.860
tinkering,

00:06.040 --> 00:06.080
but

00:06.080 --> 00:06.360
also

00:06.360 --> 00:06.560
the

00:06.560 --> 00:06.980
theoretical

00:06.980 --> 00:07.340
side

00:07.340 --> 00:07.500
of

00:07.500 --> 00:07.640
it.

00:07.840 --> 00:07.980
So

00:07.980 --> 00:08.380
space

00:08.380 --> 00:08.650
science

00:08.650 --> 00:09.440
instrumentation

00:09.440 --> 00:09.720
was

00:09.720 --> 00:10.120
like

00:10.120 --> 00:10.520
my

00:10.520 --> 00:10.840
dream

00:10.840 --> 00:11.160
job.

00:11.300 --> 00:11.480
So

00:11.480 --> 00:11.680
that

00:11.680 --> 00:12.160
means

00:12.160 --> 00:12.820
making

00:12.820 --> 00:13.100
the

00:13.100 --> 00:13.580
scientific

00:13.580 --> 00:14.080
gadgets

00:14.080 --> 00:14.370
that

00:14.370 --> 00:14.640
ride

00:14.640 --> 00:14.880
on

00:14.880 --> 00:15.100
Earth

00:15.100 --> 00:15.440
orbiting

00:15.440 --> 00:16.040
satellites,

00:16.160 --> 00:16.640
planetary

00:16.640 --> 00:17.240
probes,

00:17.380 --> 00:17.440
and

00:17.440 --> 00:17.560
where

00:17.560 --> 00:17.760
I

00:17.760 --> 00:18.080
love

00:18.080 --> 00:18.260
to

00:18.260 --> 00:18.400
do

00:18.400 --> 00:18.600
my

00:18.600 --> 00:18.820
work

00:18.820 --> 00:19.100
was

00:19.100 --> 00:19.260
at

00:19.260 --> 00:19.300
the

00:19.300 --> 00:19.860
intersection

00:19.860 --> 00:20.160
of

00:20.160 --> 00:20.460
where

00:20.460 --> 00:20.700
the

00:20.700 --> 00:20.860
science

00:20.860 --> 00:21.340
is.
