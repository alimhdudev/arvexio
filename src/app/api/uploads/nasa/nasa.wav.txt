So in school, I studied electrical engineering and physics because I absolutely love
both getting my hands dirty, tinkering, but also the theoretical side of it. So space science
instrumentation was like my dream job. So that means making the scientific gadgets that
ride on Earth orbiting satellites, planetary probes, and where I love to do my work was at the
intersection of where the science is.
