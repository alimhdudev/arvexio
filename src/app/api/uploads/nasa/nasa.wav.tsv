140	4120	So in school, I studied electrical engineering and physics because I absolutely love
4140	8650	both getting my hands dirty, tinkering, but also the theoretical side of it. So space science
8650	14370	instrumentation was like my dream job. So that means making the scientific gadgets that
14370	19300	ride on Earth orbiting satellites, planetary probes, and where I love to do my work was at the
19300	21340	intersection of where the science is.
